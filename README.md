## Tech Stack

Our team uses **IntelliJ** as its primary development IDE. That being said, this project revolves around 3 core developer tools and/or frameworks:

 - Webpack
	 - Webpack 4, specifically, is used to bundle all of our source code into a dependency graph
 - Babel
	 - We use Babel for transpiling our ES6 code into older versions of JS so that the project works on older browser(s)
 - NodeJS and NPM
     - Used to manage front-end dependencies
 - ReactJS
	 - We will be using ReactJS as our front-end javascript framework

## Setup

This project has a relatively straightforward and simple setup process. To get started, open up IntelliJ (or your preferred development playground), and use the terminal or VCS GUI to clone this remote repository into your local environment. Once you have cloned the repository, you need to install all the dependencies that the project needs. Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

 - Run `npm install`
	 - This will install all dev and nondev dependencies defined in `package.json`
 - Run `npm build`
	 - This will build and bundle our code
 - Run `npm start`********
	 - This will start the project on [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)
